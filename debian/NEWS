phpmyadmin (1:2.5.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The configuration is splitted to the /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php and
  /usr/share/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php files.
  
  The local configuration from /etc overrides global configuration.
  
  I suggest to install maintainer's version of configuration file and
  customize it later.
