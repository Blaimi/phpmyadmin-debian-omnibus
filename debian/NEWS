phpmyadmin (4:2.7.0-pl2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Configuration files coming from before phpMyAdmin 2.3.0 (released with
  Debian woody) are no longer supported.

  You can still use your config.inc.php file, but this file can be simplified,
  containing only the parameters you want to change from their corresponding
  default value in /usr/share/phpmyadmin/config.default.php.
