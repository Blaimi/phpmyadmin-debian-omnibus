phpmyadmin for Debian
---------------------


USAGE

  The application will be available at http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
  after install.
  

PROBLEM WITH COOKIES

  After upgrading the phpMyAdmin with cookie based authentication you might
  notice the problem with logging in.  Remove the cookies from your browser
  if there is no error message and you are returned to the login prompt.


CONFIGURATION

  The package installs symlink into /var/www directory. You can also add

    Alias /phpmyadmin /usr/share/phpmyadmin

  to the /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf file.

  Since 2.8.0 phpMyAdmin provides web-based setup script available at
  http://localhost/phpmyadmin/scripts/setup.php
  
  This setup script requires authorization by default. You can manage usernames
  and passwords with htpasswd command on /etc/phpmyadmin/htpasswd.setup file.


SECURITY

  The default configuration for Debian has enabled cookie based authentication.
  You *shouldn't* put your passwords into /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php file.
  This file has to be readable by www-data user, so it can be readable
  by anyone who can run its own CGI script!
