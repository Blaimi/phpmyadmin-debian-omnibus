phpmyadmin for Debian
---------------------


USAGE

  The application should be available at http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
  after install.
  
  Please note, the password can not be empty. You can change the password for
  your database with 'mysqladmin password <new-password>' command.


SECURITY

  The default configuration for Debian has enabled cookie based authentication.
  You *shouldn't* put your passwords into /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php file.
  This file has to be readable by www-data user, so it can be readable
  by anyone who can run its own CGI script!
  
  Remember, that phpMyAdmin needs an access to mysql table. You should
  give additional priviliges for a user, i.e.:
  
  GRANT USAGE ON mysql.* TO 'username@localhost'
