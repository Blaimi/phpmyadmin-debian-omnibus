---------------------

  The application will be available at http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
  after install.

  The package installs symlink into /var/www directory. You can also add

    Alias /phpmyadmin /usr/share/phpmyadmin

SECURITY

  The default configuration for Debian has enabled cookie based authentication.
