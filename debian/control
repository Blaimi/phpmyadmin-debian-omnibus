Description: MySQL web administration tool
 This package allows administering of MySQL or MariaDB with a web interface.
 .
 It allows administrators to:
  - browse through databases and tables;
  - create, copy, rename, alter and drop databases;
  - create, copy, rename, alter and drop tables;
  - perform table maintenance;
  - add, edit and drop fields;
  - execute any SQL-statement, even multiple queries;
  - create, alter and drop indexes;
  - load text files into tables;
  - create and read dumps of tables or databases;
  - export data to SQL, CSV, XML, Word, Excel, PDF and LaTeX formats;
  - administer multiple servers;
  - manage MySQL users and privileges;
  - check server settings and runtime information with configuration hints;
  - check referential integrity in MyISAM tables;
  - create complex queries using Query-by-example (QBE), automatically
    connecting required tables;
  - create PDF graphics of database layout;
  - search globally in a database or a subset of it;
  - transform stored data into any format using a set of predefined
    functions, such as displaying BLOB-data as image or download-link;
  - manage InnoDB tables and foreign keys;
 and is fully internationalized and localized in dozens of languages.
 .
 This is the omnibus-package of phpMyAdmin.
 It has all dependencies included and does therefore not follow the debian policy.
